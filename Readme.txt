Task Manager
_____________

This project was created to solidify my knowledge on important fundamentals of Python utilising my own functions and using lists
to manipulate data read from txt files and displaying helpful information to the user such as the amount of tasks which
are currently overdue etc. There are two menu's, one for the admin and a more restricted menu for any users that
are added to the database by the admin. This project was fun to create as it tested my ability several times which led to a rewarding
feeling when it was finally completed.

Installation section

and drop these files into one individual folder, keep them together. Once you have done this run the task_manager.py
in any code editor with a recognised python interpreter and with the python and pylance extensions if you are using
vscode. To login to the program, enter a username and a password from the users.txt file, once the menu is presented
you can read the prompts to learn how to navigate around the program.
